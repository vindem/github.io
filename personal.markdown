Following my idol's Leonardo Da Vinci example, when I am not working on my research and teachings I like to keep my mind and body busy with different hobbies and activities. In this page, you will find information about my passions outside research.

## Cats
I like all animals, but I consider myself a cat person. Here you can see my two cats, Behemoth and Kira.

## Tango
I dance tango argentino since 2014 and it is one of my main passions. If I am travelling around the world, it is very easy to find me checking out the local milonga(s). Here you can find some of my favourite pictures, taken in different tango events I attended.

## Table Tennis
As a teenager, I played in the italian D2 championship of table tennis for the team of my hometown, the TT Caserta (today ASD Tennistavolo San Nicola - Caserta), earning a promotion in the italian D1 championship with my team. After a long break, from 2014 to 2015 I played in the Tiroler Gebietsliga for the [Turnerschaft-Sparkasse Innsbruck Tischtennis](https://www.innsbruck-tischtennis.at/). Since 2021, I play for the [TTK Naturfreunde Stadlau](https://www.ttk-naturfreunde-stadlau.at/), in the 3. Gruppe of [WTTV](https://wttv.at/joomla/) Championship. More data about my score can be found [here](https://oettv.xttv.at/ed/index.php?uebersicht=1773&lid=7351&spid=55603&sj=23).

## Reading
I like a lot to read in my free time, even if I do not always have a chance to stop and enjoy a good book. Here are some of my favourite books:

- The thought gang - Tibor Fischer
- The hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy - Douglas Adams
- Il male oscuro - Giuseppe Berto (italian)
- The man who laughs - Victor Hugo
- The light fantastic - Terry Pratchett
- Master and Margaretha - Mikhail Bulgakov (you might have guessed this from the name of my black cat :) )

## Music
I am learning spanish guitar and enjoy playing guitar when I am in the right mood. Among my favourite guitar players you can find Paco De Lucia, Vicente Amigo, Marco Sfogli, Buckethead and Yngwie Malmsteen. I also like to listen to music when I work, ranging from classical music, metal, hard rock, pop rock.

## Trekking
Walking is the closest thing to meditation, for me. When I get the chance, I like to go for long trekking trips, such as the [Camino de Santiago](https://www.caminodesantiago.gal/en) and the [via Francigena](https://www.viefrancigene.org/en/). If you are around my hometown, I can strongly recommend the [Sentiero degli dei](https://costieraamalfitana.com/en/the-path-of-the-gods/) (literally "The path of the gods"), a breathtaking hike in the Amalfi Coast on the path that connects Bomerano to Positano.
