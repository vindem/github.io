After successful completion of the course, students are able to understand quantum computing methods and apply them for the development of hybrid applications, i.e., applications that consist of classic and quantum tasks, and apply them to typical scientific applications. After basic notions of quantum computing, necessaries for the development of quantum programs, students will have to develop different programs to solve typical scientific computing problems, i.e., computation of inter-atomic distances, eigenvalues calculation and optimization problems. Students will have to solve up to four different assignments, ranging from purely theoretical ones to purely programming-oriented ones, and describe their solutions in a report. As programming framework, we will employ IBM Qiskit, which already provides student programs to let students experiment with real quantum machines.
