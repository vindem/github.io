I am Vincenzo De Maio, a Postdoctoral Researcher at Vienna University of Technology. My main interests are Quantum Computing, with special focus on Quantum Machine Learning and Quantum Optimization, Edge/Cloud Computing, Sustainable Computing and Distributed Systems.

I received my Ph.D in Computer Science at the [University of Innsbruck](http://www.uibk.ac.at) in November 2016, under the supervision of [Univ. Prof. Dr. Radu Prodan](http://www.itec.aau.at/~radu/) and [Dr. Gabor Kecskemeti](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gabor-Kecskemeti). My Ph.D. thesis, "Virtual Machine Migration Energy Consumption Simulation in Cloud Computing", is available in the [Resources](/resources/) section of the website. 

Since 2017, I am working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Information Systems Engineering of the [Vienna University of Technology](http://www.tuwien.ac.at), in the [HPC research group](http://hpc.ec.tuwien.ac.at/), whose leader is [Univ. Prof. Dr. Ivona Brandic](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/people/ivona-brandic). 

Since 2023, I also collaborate with the [Department of Experimental Physics of the University of Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/exphys/index.html.de) and [dr. Thomas Monz](https://www.quantumoptics.at/en/people-list.html) as CO-PI of the HPQC FFG Leitprojekt Project, whose goal is the integration of quantum hardware in HPC systems.

My research has been well received by scientific community, with around 25 peer-reviewed publications in top venues, including IEEE Transactions on Services Computing, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing, Elsevier Future Generation Computer Systems and IEEE/ACM CCGRID. In the IEEE/ACM UCC 2016 I have also been awarded with the Best Paper Award conference for my work on energy modelling of VM migration, [An improved model for live migration in data centre simulators](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2996890.2996892), co-authored with Gabor Kecskemeti and Radu Prodan. More details about my publications can be found on the [Publications](/publications/) section of the website.

I participated in several research projects funded by organizations like [FWF](https://www.fwf.ac.at) (Austrian Science Fund), [FFG](https://www.ffg.at/en) (Austrian Research Promotion Agency) and the italian [PON](https://www.istruzione.it/pon/) (Operative National Program). In 2016, I have been employed by Universitaâ€œ` degli studi di Salerno for the multidisciplinary project [eHealthNet](https://www.ehealthnet.it/progetto-ehealthnet/), that involved collaborations with physiotherapists in the development of a e-health platform for post-hearth surgery rehabilitation. Since 2017, I have been working in different research project, including FWF-START Program project [RUCON](http://rucon.ec.tuwien.ac.at/), City of Vienna [InTraSafEd5G](https://intrasafed.ec.tuwien.ac.at/) and CHIST-ERA [SWAIN](https://www.chistera.eu/projects/swain). In particular, [my work on InTraSafEd5G and SWAIN](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000136176620/kuenstliche-intelligenzwie-die-sicherheit-im-strassenverkehr-und-das-klima-durch) was mentioned on the online version of Der Standard, one of the most widely read newspapers in Austria. Since 2023, I am CO-PI in the FFG Leitprojekt [HPQC](https://projekte.ffg.at/projekt/4562957). More details about my research projects experience can be found in the [Projects](/projects/) section of the website.  

I also serve as reviewer for high-impact journals including [IEEE TCC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6245519), [IEEE TPDS](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/td), [TNSM](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tnsm) as well as in technical program committee of prestigious international conferences such as ACM Supercomputing, IEEE GLOBECOM, IEEE CLOUDCOM, IEEE CLOUD, IEEE EDGE, IEEE IPDPS, IEEE/ACM UCC and IEEE/ACM CCGrid.
